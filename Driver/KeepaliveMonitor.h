	Explanation of ping-response scheme
	===================================

	p = ping
	r = response
	** = _pingInterval
	- = waiting for response

	p--r 
	    **pr
		    **p---r
		           **p--r
	|___|___|___|___|___|___|___| etc..
	t0  t1  t2.. 

	Actual real ping interval is >= _pingInterval, which is a lower bound.
	A new ping is only sent out once a response has been received, or we reach _responseTimeout.

The blue screen hypothesis

We get a ton of haptics. They are being written async to the suit.

We get bad pings. Okay, lets search for a new connection.

But wait, access denied opening the port because technically it's still opened because it never got closed

But wait, we can't close it or else we get a blue screen because of buggy driver?

PurgeComm
FlushFileBuffers

Ok So I cancel() and then close(), so no more access denied errors.

Seperate problem is when unplugging physical device and bad stuff happens

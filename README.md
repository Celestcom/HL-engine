# Engine
Source for the runtime that allows game engine plugins to communicate with the Hardlight suit. Contains an incomplete API allowing it to connect to any haptic peripheral, such as OpenVR devices or other suits/controllers. Can be plugged in as a DLL to the Hardlight windows service.

### Please note:
Hardlight VR was a complex project involving many dependencies. We have decided to open the code in the hopes that others may make use of the tools and plugins we built over the last 5 years. However, some software may not have been built or tested in some time, and may require changes to be used with the latest VR software and technology. 

### Contributing and Contact
We welcome any and all interest in derivative projects made from this software, edits to the software, and updates to the plugins and drivers! If you are interested in contributing to the public Hardlight repositories, please create an issue, or email hardlightvr@gmail.com.
